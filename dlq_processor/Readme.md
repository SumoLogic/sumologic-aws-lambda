This fork will only send the raw logs to sumo without trying to pre-parse or wrap in a JSON message.

# SumoLogic Lambda Function for AWS CloudWatch Logs

This is used for collecting Amazon CloudWatch Logs.It provides two lambda functions

* SumoCWLogsLambda: It’s a lambda function responsible for sending data to Sumo logic HTTP endpoint.It is configured with dead letter queue(SumoCWDeadLetterQueue) which gets the messages which can’t be processed successfully. Also you can subscribe other logs to this function except its own log group.
* SumoCWProcessDLQLambda: It’s a lambda function responsible for reading messages from dead letter queue and retries sending messages.It gets triggered periodically by AWS CloudWatch Events using schedule rule(SumoCWProcessDLQScheduleRule).

It also configured with CloudWatch Alarm which triggers when number of messages in DeadLetterQueue exceeds threshold defined in cloudformation template.

### Creating Stack in AWS Cloudformation
you can create the stack by using [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-creating-stack.html) or directly from aws console using webbrowser and uploading DLQLambdaCloudFormation.json. For more details checkout it's [documentation](https://help.sumologic.com/Send-Data/Collect-from-Other-Data-Sources/Amazon-CloudWatch-Logs)

### Configuring Lambda

The following AWS Lambda environment variables are supported in both the lambda functions.Please note that both the functions should have same values configured to avoid inconsistencies.

* SUMO_ENDPOINT (REQUIRED) - SumoLogic HTTP Collector endpoint URL.
* ENCODING (OPTIONAL) - Encoding to use when decoding CloudWatch log events. Default is 'utf-8'.
* SOURCE_CATEGORY_OVERRIDE (OPTIONAL) - Override _sourceCategory metadata field within SumoLogic.
* SOURCE_HOST_OVERRIDE (OPTIONAL) - Override _sourceHost metadata field within SumoLogic.
* SOURCE_NAME_OVERRIDE (OPTIONAL) - Override _sourceName metadata field within SumoLogic.

SumoCWProcessDLQLambda supports one extra environment variable
* NUM_OF_WORKERS(REQUIRED): It’s default value is 4. It controls the number of instances of SumoCWProcessDLQLambda to spawn if there is no failure in first attempt.It helps in faster processing of pending messages in dead letter queue.

# Dynamic Metadata Fields

The lambda supports dynamically overriding the _sourceName, _sourceHost and _sourceCategory per log message by setting `_sumo_metadata` within a json log.

This can be useful when writing to CloudWatch Logs via a lambda function.

For example:

```
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {

    var serverIp = '123.123.123.123'

    console.log(JSON.stringify({
        'message': 'something happened..',
        '_sumo_metadata': {
            'category': 'prod/appa/console',
            'sourceName': 'other_source',
            'sourceHost': serverIp
        }

    }));
    console.log('some other log message with default sourceCategory');
};

```
